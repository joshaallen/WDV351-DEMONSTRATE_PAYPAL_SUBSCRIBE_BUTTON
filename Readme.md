# **Unit-4: PayPal Standard**

## 4-4:PayPal Subscription Button Example

Create a web page that will allow a customer to use a Subscription button from PayPal.
  1. Demonstrate a newsletter product with a 1 year subscription.
  2. Demonstrate a Membership product with a 3 month subscription.

Demonstrate your example to the class using your Sandbox accounts. 

I would recommend using an existing site that you have built.  Remember to format it and style it so that it looks like a professional example of your work.  This is a key portfolio item.  

It is expected that these demonstration examples are working applications and should be presented/styled that way. 

**NOTE:** This button may require you to have a Verified Account.  If so, you do not have to do this assignment if you do not wish to.
